  <li>In charge to develop and run experiments in High Energy Physics (HEP) and Grid Computing. As to my activity in HEP, I worked in the ”Compact Muon Solenoid” experiment. As to my activity in Grid Computing, I contributed to the development of a tool to monitor the resources of grid computing ”GridICE”. This tool was used to monitor the resources and the applications in the grid environment and to help detecting faulty situations, contract violations and user-defined events.</li>
  <li>I had the task of maintaining and monitoring the “Bari Tier-2 Computing Center” performance in order to support the overall needs of Physics Experiments. I participated to the software analyses by developing and using some software tools to analyze millions of real and simulated event data. I developed and studied a Simulation Model of Grid environment, using a software system called Ptolemy II (a set of Java packages supporting heterogeneous modeling, simulation, and design of concurrent systems).</li>
